# SatMod-&#x3bb;

Satellite constellation analysis software.

## Overview

*Currently a work-in-progress.* The purpose of this software is to efficiently
model satellite coverage, and possibly other useful constellation management
metrics. To build from source, import the project into [Nightcode][1] (tested
using version 0.4.2) and select `Build` to download the code dependencies and
generate a stand-alone (executable) JAR.

To run the stand-alone JAR file, using Java 7 or higher, execute:

    java -jar satmod-lambda-XXX-standalone.jar

replacing `XXX` with the version number.
